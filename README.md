# Jupyter notebooks from my YouTube videos

Do you enjoy my YouTube channel (https://YouTube.com/reuvenlerner)?  If so, then you've probably noticed I use Jupyter and Marimo notebooks in nearly every video.  This repo contains the notebooks from some of my videos.  As I do more videos, I'll add them here.

If you have comments about my videos, or suggestions for topics I can/should address in the future, please let me know! You can reach me most easily at [reuven@lernerpython.com](mailto:reuven@lernerpython.com).
